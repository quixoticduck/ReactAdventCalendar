coding:
    make fireworks happen on door 25 (tutorial) or reindeer
    make them unzoom when you click the background (make container as big as screen) and have css change from pointer to hand
    make it so when zoomed in the back button will go back to main page

art:
    redraw holly image
    draw enough images for 25 doors


done:
hover over openable doors have a box shadow/glow
add test mode for when it isn't december 25th
doors should only open on correct dates
get rid of numbers when doors open
center the close door button
fix door 25 and 
enlarge open image thumbnails on click?
change enlarged background from red
doors only open on correct dates, numbers disappear when doors open, the close door button has been centered, door 25 no longer has an error and probably works but hasn't been tested as the date is the first of the month today
